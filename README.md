# Automotive-Dealership-React-App
Design by Seneca SDDS, Implementation by Shervin Tafreshipour

This react front-end service was built as part of a larger application for a web-development class. It's purpose is to essentially replicate the basic functionality of a used-car
dealership where cars can be viewed, bought, and sold. All basic CRUD operations are possible.
